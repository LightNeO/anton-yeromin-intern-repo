# Reflections
1. How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates? I focus on clarity and structure to reduce cognitive load.

Written Follow-ups: After verbal syncs, I send a short bulleted summary so teammates can process the information at their own pace.

Explicit Instructions: I avoid implied meanings or idioms. Instead of saying "Let's touch base," I say "Let's meet at 16:00 to discuss the login bug."

2. What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

"The Wall of Shame": Visualizing gaps in habit tracking (e.g., broken streaks in red) can induce guilt and cause users with ADHD to abandon the app entirely.

Sensory Overload: Unexpected sounds or auto-playing animations during onboarding can be overwhelming.

Vague Error Messages: Errors like "Something went wrong" cause anxiety. Users need to know exactly what happened and how to fix it.

3. What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations? As an Automation QA, I will integrate accessibility checks into my test scripts.

Action: When writing selectors for buttons or inputs, I will prioritize using aria-labels (used by screen readers) instead of generic CSS classes. This ensures we are verifying the app is ready for assistive technology.

# Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.

For now I did not use Focus Bear app so far, but I think it could be:
Implement a "Forgiveness Mode" or change the tone of Error Messages.
For example if current message: "Error: You tried to visit a blocked site!" (Red color), change to a softer tone: "Oops, looks like you wanted to focus. This site can wait for now." (Neutral color).


# Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning.
My hypothetical Response:

Hi there,

It is completely normal to feel overwhelmed when looking at a new tool with lots of features. In fact, "decision paralysis" is something many of us deal with when trying to get organized. You are not alone in this.

Let’s forget about "optimizing" everything right now. We don't need to set up the perfect schedule today. Let’s just try one simple thing:
Ignore the "Morning Routine" and "Night Routine" tabs for now. You don't need them yet.

Go to the "Focus Modes" tab.
Create a mode called "Just 5 Minutes."
Add just one distraction to block (like social media or news).
Save it.
That is it. If you can do that today, you have succeeded.
Once you are comfortable with that single step, we can look at the other features later. There is no rush.
I am here to help you with the next step whenever you are ready.

Best regards,

Anton yeromin
