# 1 How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Daily meetings: Instead of interrupting developers with questions randomly, there are dedicated times to raise blockers, which protects everyone's focus time.

Sprint Review(or Demo Meetings) force the team to show actual working software, eliminating miscommunication about "how done" a feature really is.

Retro: ensures the team aligns on process improvements, not just product features, fixing communication breakdowns before they fester

# 2 Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

I think for me as an automation engineer, Sprint Planning is the most important because it is where the "Acceptance Criteria" are finalized.
I cannot write an automated test script if I don't know exactly how the feature is supposed to behave. If I start coding based on a vague requirement, I will likely have to rewrite my script later. Planning clarifies these details upfront.

# 3 Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.

For now I only started my onboarding, so not sure if I'm able to improve team work
