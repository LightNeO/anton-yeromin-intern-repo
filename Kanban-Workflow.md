# Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role

I think good idea would be to utilizing 'Definition of Done' Checklists within Cards

As an intern, it is easy to forget small but crucial steps like "add docstrings," "update requirements.txt," or "run local flake8" before pushing.
By adding a checkbox list of these requirements inside every Kanban card, I ensure I don't move a task to "Ready for Review" prematurely.
This reduces the back-and-forth in code reviews and saves my mentor's time.
