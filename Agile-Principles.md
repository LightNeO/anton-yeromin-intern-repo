# 1. Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words:

    1.1 Scrum has iterations(Sprints), usually 2-4 weeks
    1.2 Kanban uses continious workflow
    2.1 Scrum has specific roles(Scrum master, Product owner etc)
    2.2 Kanban has no predefined roles
    3.1 Scrum has its own meeting types: Daily, Backlog, Sprint planning etc
    3.2 Kanban has no mandatory meetings
    4.1 Scope of works in scrum is fixed and defined at the sprint start
    4.2 In Kanban it is flexible, also Kanban has WIP(Work in progress) limits

# 2. Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.

I think this one - "Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."
Test automation requires the same level of architectural care and "technical excellence" as the product code itself. If the test framework is poorly designed or the scripts are messy, the "technical debt" will eventually slow down the entire release cycle, making the team less agile
