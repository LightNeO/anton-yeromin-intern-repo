# User Manual for A ton Yeromin

## My role

    I am working on:
        (Primary Focus) Automating regression tests using Python
        Converting manual test cases into automated scripts
        Setting up test environments and CI/CD pipeline integration

    Things that I bring from my Senior QA background:
        Test strategy and coverage analysis
        Bug reporting and root cause analysis
        Defining Acceptance Criteria (AC)

    The days and times I work are:
        Monday – Friday usually from 16:00 to 18:00 (Kyiv Time / GMT+2)

## How I Work Best

    I do my best work when:
        I have a clear "Definition of Done" before I start task
        I have deadlines
        I can collaborate with others
        I can focus deeply without interruptions
        
    
    I struggle when:
        I get interrupted frequently (context switching is hard in a short shift)
        Requirements are vague or undocumented
        I have to guess the expected behavior of a feature

## Communication Style

    I prefer messages to be...
        Async: Detailed text is better than a quick call, so I can reference it when I log on(But if I'm online feel free to make a call if needed)

    The best way to reach me is:
        Discord: @light08936

## Collaboration & Teamwork

    I work best in a team when everyone are on the "same page", sociable, ask questions and look for ways to solve problems/issues together

    My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is:
        when requirements change but no one updates the ticket.
        "It works on my machine" (without verifying in the test environment).

    If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means:
        I am processing the technical information.

## Focus & Productivity

    I stay focused by:
        Using Focus Bear to block distractions
        Working in a strict timebox.

    Things that distract me:
        Notifications from channels not relevant to my task.

    The best way to support my productivity is:
        Quick responses to my questions. And cookies

## Feedback & Growth

    I like feedback to be:
        Direct and specific. If my code is inefficient, show me some correct example
        Written. I like to have a record of feedback to study later.

    When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is:
        Leave a comment on the PR or send a DM.

    I appreciate it when teammates:
        Acknowledge that I am learning the tool (Python), but I know the trade (QA).

## Fun Facts & Quirks

    One thing people often misunderstand about me is:
        That "Intern" means "New to the industry." I actually have significant experience as a Manual QA Engineer. So if you need some help in Manual tasks, just ping me.

    A fun fact about me:
        I enjoy 3D printing (I have a Bambu Lab A1 mini). Also like anime and gaming

My work superpower is:
    The Tester's Mindset. I can spot edge cases and potential bugs before a single line of code is written.
