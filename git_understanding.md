# What caused the conflict?
 Just for testing I created simple function that adds a + b, in another branch I changed it to a - b
# How did you resolve it?
 After merge comand I received merge conflict(separate conflict file was opened because i use VS code), I manualy saved new version a - b, added the to staging area and commited changes
# What did you learn?
 Nothing new, I already know about it, just a small practice
