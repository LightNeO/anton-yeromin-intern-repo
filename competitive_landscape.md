# 1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear acts as a hybrid solution.
Freedom & Cold Turkey are primarily "policemen"—they stop you from doing bad things (blocking), but they don't guide you on what to do.
Tiimo & Routinery are "coaches"—they guide you through habits and schedules, but they don't stop you from navigating away to Instagram (soft enforcement).
Focus Bear is unique because it combines both: It acts as a habit coach (like Routinery) that locks the door to distractions (like Cold Turkey) simultaneously. It doesn't just say "Do Yoga"; it blocks your email until you confirm you have done Yoga.

# 2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I would choose Focus Bear for "The Morning Routine Enforcer." Most apps (like Freedom) rely on willpower to start the blocking session. Focus Bear removes willpower from the equation.

# 3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
Tiimo has a better Visual Timeline (UI/UX)

# 4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
Not sure. I need to use Focus Bear app more to suggest some improvements
