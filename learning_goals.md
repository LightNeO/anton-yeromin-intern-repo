# What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I want to learn how to build maintainable, scalable test frameworks using that integrate seamlessly into a CI/CD pipeline.

# What skills are you most excited to develop?
Python coding, different framworks and libraries that usuillt used, CI/CD, basics of JavaScript and SQL

# What do you think you can contribute to the team?
Even though I am an intern in QA Auto, I have big experiance in Manual QA, so I can help team to handle manual tasks

# What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I think it is "architecting test frameworks from scratch". I can write individual tests, but deciding on the best folder structure, class hierarchy, or how to handle global configurations (like the Page Object Model pattern) is where I need mentorship and practice.

# What does success in this internship look like for you?
I think it would be a point where I can pick up a ticket, write a clean, passing automated test, and have it merged into the main branch with minimal corrections on code style.
