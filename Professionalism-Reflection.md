1. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
I experienced the best teamwork in a "No Blame Culture." When a critical bug appeared, developers and QAs swarmed to fix it together instead of pointing fingers. I usually trying to do my best to help devs in this case

2. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
Since I work asynchronously, I prioritize context. I include all relevant links, logs, and screenshots in my first message so teammates don't have to wait for me to come back online to ask clarifying questions.

3. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

Celebrate wins: I share memes or GIFs when a difficult test finally passes.

Support: If a colleague breaks the build, I offer help to fix it privately instead of calling them out publicly.

4. How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
The best would be to review the relevant tickets beforehand and come with a written questions.

5. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
Even as an intern in automation, I apply my Manual QA experiance by:
Updating outdated documentation if needed.
Suggesting tests for "edge cases," not just automating the happy path.

6. How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them?
After ~ 24 Hours: A friendly nudge in the thread ("Just bumping this").

7. What are some things you won't do?
Not sure, it all depends on the situation. usually something that goes beyond a friendly work environment
