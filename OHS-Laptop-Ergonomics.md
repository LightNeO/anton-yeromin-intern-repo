1. What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?

Laptop Stand: Since I work on a laptop, I will use a stand to raise the screen to eye level to prevent neck strain.

External Keyboard/Mouse: This allows me to keep my arms at a 90-degree angle while the screen is elevated.

1. What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?

The 20-20-20 Rule: To reduce eye strain from reading test logs, every 20 minutes I will look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

"Turtle Neck" Check: I will consciously pull my chin back and lean into the backrest of my chair instead of leaning forward into the screen.

1. How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?

Focus Bear Config: I will configure Focus Bear to trigger a mandatory 5-minute stretch break every hour.

Hard Stop: Since I only work 2 hours (16:00–18:00), I will set a "Micro-break" at 17:00 to stand up and reset my focus.

# Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.

As for me I use my laptop 99% of time with 2 additional monitors. It Helps a lot
And just few days ago I bought a chair with a back support, and it's amazing!!!
