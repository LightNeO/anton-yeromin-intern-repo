# 1. Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.

As an Automation QA Intern, my role is to support the team by converting manual test cases into automated scripts.
I contribute to the team's velocity by taking on repetitive regression testing tasks, allowing QAs and Developers to focus on complex feature work. By participating in stand-ups and sprint planning, I ensure my automation tasks align with the team's current priorities

# 2. Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.

Most of all I'll colaborate with Manual QAs and Devs
I can improve teamwork by being proactive about feedback rather than waiting for it:
As I'm just an intern, I should ask alot of questions and be active in communication so that my tasks would be as good as possoble
